# pomodoro

My idea came from thinking about how would someone want to use a pomodoro as being incorporated as part of their website.
I thought that it should be a small float on top icon that would simply display the minute count. Any other features would
come after selecting the floating tomato.

I used the following as inspiration for the ui of this project.

fonts and libs folders are used for local development. They have glyphicons and bootstrap.css, angular.min.js, respectively.
